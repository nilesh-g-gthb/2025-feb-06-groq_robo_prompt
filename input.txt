1. Analyze the provided data and identify any information related to bonds.
        2. Extract the values for ISIN, security detail(info), issuer, Coupon, Maturity, Quantam(QTM), bid, offer for each bond.
        3. If any of these fields are missing for a bond, use null for that field.
        4. If no relevant bond information is found, return an empty list.
        5. Identify the security detail e.g. : "7.62% NABARD 31-Jan-2028", "12.90 Electronica Sept 29"
        6. Identify the issuer name e.g. : "NABARD", "Electronica"
        7. For Coupon values:
           - Sometime coupon can be in Security name eg : "7.62% NABARD 31-Jan-2028" here 7.62 is coupon, you need to extract it
           - If the value is between 0 and 1, it's likely in decimal form. Multiply it by 100 to convert to a percentage.
           - If the value is already between 5 and 15, it's likely already in percentage form. Use it as is.
           - If the value is outside these ranges, use your best judgment to interpret it correctly.  
        8. For Maturity date keep standard format you may get different formats from data but convert it to yyyy-mm-dd
        9. For Quantam interprete the data and give me number which will be in multiple of 10 lacs, eg: if quantam is "10 lacs multiples" than give 1 , can also be called as QTM  
Format the extracted information as a list of JSON objects. Each JSON object in the list should have this structure:
    {{
        "isinNo": string or null,
        "security": string or null,
        "issuer": string or null,
        "coupon": number or null,
        "maturityDate": String or null,
        "offerYtm": number or null
        "quantam" or "Amount": number or null 
    }}
